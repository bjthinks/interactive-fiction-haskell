consider handling plurals in error messages in Visible.hs (e.g. acorns)?
See if I can do better when the ParseError is an unexpected end of input

commands to implement:
read jar
play with the black cat
burn ants
look in backpack
get ants
enter dollhouse
go dollhouse
feed squirrel
pull book
feed misty the banana!!!
feed squirrel the acorns

Consider making room names bold in the (implicit or explicit) look
command.

Look at
git diff 4e6c8beaeb981551c97c52514b0e3280567795d8 06340e4c264f111607853be82b9c0cf0a058718d
and restore the deleted functions?
