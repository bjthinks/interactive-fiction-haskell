points:
  use capsella toy (in bathtub)
  holy water in bathroom to throw at ghost
add more immobile items for flavor
boards creak in different place?
describe hhLanding
burn ants (with magnifying glass)
use glass on ants?
"water grass with magnifying glass" will burn the ants
maybe it's time to use a Map String (Game ()) for verbs instead of all these
  individual actions
throw acorn at squirrel
consider handling plurals in error messages in Categories.hs (e.g. acorns)?
light candle with match -- complicated
See if I can do better when the ParseError is an unexpected end of input
what do you want to lock, unlock, open it with?
