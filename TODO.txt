add more immobile items for flavor
describe hhLanding
use glass on ants?
consider handling plurals in error messages in Categories.hs (e.g. acorns)?
See if I can do better when the ParseError is an unexpected end of input
use matches -- change to light match eventually?
failUseDollhouse -- use cant
consider allowing "it" as a noun in the parser -- would have to check if
  the ref is still visible before allowing it to be parsed
