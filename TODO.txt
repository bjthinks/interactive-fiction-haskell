consider handling plurals in error messages in Categories.hs (e.g. acorns)?
See if I can do better when the ParseError is an unexpected end of input
consider allowing "it" as a noun in the parser -- would have to check if
  the ref is still visible before allowing it to be parsed

commands to implement:
read jar
play with the black cat
burn ants
look in backpack
get ants
enter dollhouse
go dollhouse
feed squirrel
pull book

Consider making room names bold in the (implicit or explicit) look
command.
