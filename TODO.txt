points:
  use capsella toy (in bathtub)
  holy water in bathroom to throw at ghost
add more immobile items for flavor
boards creak in different place?
describe hhLanding
burn ants (with magnifying glass)
use glass on ants?
consider handling plurals in error messages in Categories.hs (e.g. acorns)?
light candle with match -- complicated
See if I can do better when the ParseError is an unexpected end of input
use matches -- change to light match eventually?
failUseDollhouse -- use cant
turn on the bar light
use words in parser to eliminate verb1m'
consider read math book -> (After taking it out of the backpack) ??
consider allowing "it" as a noun in the parser -- would have to check if
  the ref is still visible before allowing it to be parsed
